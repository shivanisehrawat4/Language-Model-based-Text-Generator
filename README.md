# Language-Model-based-Text-Generator

This project implements a language model-based text generator using the GPT-2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The generator interacts with users through an interactive conversational interface, producing contextually relevant responses based on user prompts.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it.
3. Install project dependencies using pip: 
    pip install tensorflow transformers

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: 
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-model-text-generator.git
    cd language-model-text-generator

2. Open the `text_generator.py` script to explore and interact with the text generator functions.

3. Run the script in your Python environment:
    python text_generator.py

Follow the prompts to start interactive conversations and explore the generator's capabilities.

### Features

- Interactive conversations with the text generator.
- Generating multiple variations of responses to enhance diversity.
- User control over text style using style tokens.
- Fine-tuning parameters for response diversity and quality.

## Project Summary

The project involves creating a language model-based text generator using the GPT-2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. Users interact with the generator through an interactive conversation interface. The generator responds to user prompts by producing text that is contextually relevant. Extensions include generating multiple variations of responses, allowing users to control the text style, and simulating interactive conversations. The project seeks to enhance response diversity through parameter adjustments like temperature, repetition penalty, max length, and sampling techniques.
